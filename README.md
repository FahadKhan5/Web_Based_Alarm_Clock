# Web_Based_Alarm_Clock

The Web-Based Alarm Clock Application is a versatile and user-friendly digital alarm clock developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web application provides a convenient and customizable way for users to set alarms and receive timely reminders, making it an essential tool for time management and organization.

This alarm clock offers a sleek and modern design with a digital clock display that includes the current time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats. Users can easily set new alarms by specifying the desired time using a time input field. The application allows users to add multiple alarms, which are displayed in a list format for easy reference.

One of the standout features of this application is its ability to store alarm settings locally, ensuring that alarms are not lost when the user refreshes the page or closes the browser. This ensures that important reminders are never missed.

Each alarm in the list can be individually toggled on or off, giving users full control over which alarms are active. When an alarm goes off, an attention-grabbing audio alert is triggered to notify the user of the specified time. Users can easily snooze or dismiss alarms as needed.

The Web-Based Alarm Clock Application is responsive and works seamlessly on various devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones, allowing users to access their alarms from anywhere with an internet connection.

This open-source project is ideal for individuals looking for a straightforward and customizable digital alarm clock solution. It can be used for a wide range of applications, from waking up in the morning to setting reminders for important tasks throughout the day.
